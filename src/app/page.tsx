        <Typography>
          Real estate investors and â€˜wholesalersâ€™ effectively deploy mass
          marketing strategies, eg. cold calling, text blasts, email campaigns,
          bandit signs, social media and more to find specific sellers who are
          motivated to sell their home in a short time frame without using a
          traditional sales model. The sellers that these wholesalers contact
          who are interested in selling, but who would prefer to use a
          conventional sales strategy by selling with a Realtor at the highest
          retail price are deemed â€˜dead leadsâ€™ by wholesalers and nothing is
          typically done to follow through or monetize these leads.Â  However,
          these leads are incredibly valuable to real estate agents looking to
          work with more seller clients.Â  LeadViver creates a marketplace for
          these valuable leads that enables wholesalers to recoup some of their
          marketing costs and agents to grow their businesses.
